- Saildrones can provide a comprehensive insight into submesoscale interactions with some limitations that can be accounted for with additional data from models
- We have a library of temperature fronts identified using the methods above, the analysis of these fronts provide an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Saildrones
We have presented a case study of different wind, wave, and current interactions along submesoscale fronts recorded by Saildrones. Our analysis has provided an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Saildrones. 
Saildrones provide a comprehensive insight into submesoscale interactions with minor limitations due to a lack of large-scale spatial coverage. This limitation can be accounted for with supplemental model data.
