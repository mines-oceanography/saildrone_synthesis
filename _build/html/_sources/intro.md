## Introduction

The interactions between winds, waves, and currents are responsible for the exchange of mass, momentum, and heat in the air-sea boundary layer (Villas BÃ´as and Pizzo 2021). Waves serve as the interface between the atmosphere and ocean, playing a key role in the air-sea fluxes. Understanding the role of waves in these fluxes is essential to better understand the interplay between the atmospheric and oceanic systems of the Earth (Cavaleri et al. 2012).

The response time for the effects of winds and currents can occur over a broad range of temporal scales (days to hours) and spatial scales (thousands to single kilometers). These interactions have been validated with model and satellite observations, but only at the mesoscale range (~30-100 km). At the submesoscale range (<30 km), there is a distinct lack of observations and, of those that exist, the current, wind, and wave data is collected independently.

In the SUB-MESOSCALE OCEAN DYNAMICS EXPERIMENT (SMODE), Saildrones were used to collect colocalized current, wind, and wave observations along their trajectories. A library of fronts was identified to provide an insight into the three-way coupling between currents, winds, and waves in the submesoscale.

This analysis utilizes collocated Saildrone observations to investigate how variations in winds and currents influence wave characteristics.
