Saildrone observations provide comprehensive insights into submesoscale interactions between winds, waves, and currents. However, these observations are restricted in space. To address these spatial restrictions, we combine saildrone measurements with numerical outputs, which provides broader spatial context and enables the identification of large-scale processes that may influence local wave variables. However, numerical models are based on numerous assumptions and are inherently imperfect. At best, they serve as a safeguard in the interpretation of our in-situ observations. Using the methodology outlined [here](content:methods:labels), we identified a library of temperature fronts and analyzed how wind, wave, and currents evolve along these fronts.
