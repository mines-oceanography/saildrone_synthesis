Saildrones can provide a comprehensive insight into submesoscale interactions with some limitations that can be accounted for with additional data from models. This data however, is not perfect. We are able to leverage model outputs for our benefit, but not all processes are resolved in models and these outputs are limited by the spatial gridding of each model.

We have a library of temperature fronts identified using the methods above, the analysis of these fronts provide an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Saildrones We have presented a case study of different wind, wave, and current interactions along submesoscale fronts recorded by Saildrones. Our analysis has provided an insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Saildrones. Saildrones provide a comprehensive insight into submesoscale interactions with minor limitations due to a lack of large-scale spatial coverage. This limitation can be accounted for with supplemental model data.
